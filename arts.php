                        <p class="card-text" align="justify">Machine Learning programs and algorithms emphasize on learning from examples. Machine learning teaches computers to learn from experience. Instead of using a preset equation as a model, machine learning algorithms "learn" information directly from data using computational techniques. As the amount of samples available for learning grows, the algorithms perform better and better in an adaptive manner. Two methods are used in machine learning: unsupervised learning, which looks for innate structures or hidden patterns in input data, and supervised learning, which trains a model using known input and output data to predict future outputs. The lab provides software, hardware and Internet resources to conduct these high end tasks for the knowledge and skills of the students.</p>

AI technology is increasing efficiency and performance in businesses by automating procedures or jobs that previously needed human labour. Additionally, AI is able to interpret data at a scale beyond human comprehension. That ability can yield significant business advantages. Repetitive learning and data-driven discovery are automated by AI. Artificial Intelligence handles repetitive, high-volume, digital activities rather than automating manual ones. And it does so without growing weary.

                            The lab focuses on conducting practical assignments related to cloud computing and virtualization. Cloud computing is on-demand access, via the internet, to computing resources—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage, development tools, networking capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed by a cloud services provider (or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them according to usage. The term ‘cloud computing’ also refers to the technology that makes cloud work. This includes some form of virtualized IT infrastructure—servers, operating system software, networking, and other infrastructure that’s abstracted, using special software, so that it can be pooled and divided irrespective of physical hardware boundaries. For example, a single hardware server can be divided into multiple virtual servers.

These gadgets, commonly referred to as "smart objects," can be anything from basic "smart home" appliances like smart thermostats to wearables like smartwatches and garments with RFID capabilities to sophisticated industrial and transportation systems. IoT-based "smart cities" as a whole are even being imagined by technologists.

The students of MBA were taken to Amritsar at Hanni Industries. The industry dealt in various export quality products. They manufacture many Indian spices, Jaggery and its related products. They also deal in Kesar exports. The countries in which they export their products are Canada, New Zealand, England and many others. Their 95% business is based on exports. The owner of the industry said that he got inspired from his mother’s illness and started manufacturing pure products. He worked as one-man army at the earliest stages of business and then over the years has transformed it into a full-fledged industry. The students have learned a lot in this visit and have given positive feedback and appreciated our prestigious institute for arranging such visits. </p>

Dr. Amudhavel briefed the students about the domains of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and how they are impacting everyday activities. He discussed the applications of AI and ML in social networks in creating content, segregating content and automation of office work. He discussed a few websites showcasing AI open-source projects for students. Students were interested in watching 3D and graphics generated by algorithms which are quite popular on various social media platforms. He shared certification courses and projects which students can take up and make a career in AI/ ML.</p>
