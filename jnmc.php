        Department of Journalism &amp; Mass Communication help students to be
excellent in the field of media and writing by providing them academic
education as well as practical exposure. Three year undergraduate
degree program will help them to be sharp in practices and confident to
choose their field of interest. It provides students technical skills and
social understanding which able them to write about and convey
information to the general public about business, history, culture, budget
issues, governmental matters, entertainment, and sports via mass
communication channels such as television, radio, and web-based social
networks. Because the discipline of journalism is founded on truth,
autonomy, and transparency, the course gives comprehensive

            <p align="justify">Department provides quality education to the students which includes
Lectures, Case Studies, tutorials as well as hands on practice for soft
skills. The Institute provides an excellent academic environment with
focus on self- learning. The teaching and learning methodologies follow
a rigorous regime that involves intensive and extensive working on
challenging academic tasks. The teaching is emphasized through
student centered and discovery method of learning in place of the
conventional teacher centered learning. Peer to Peer learning is

encouraged. Exposure to state- of- the –art infrastructure, technology,
professional and field experiences are brought to students through
visiting faculties from various Industry and Mentoring exercises.
Interactive Teaching methods (use of internet, CDs, Projectors, Power
point presentation) by the faculties help the students in better
understanding of the topics. ICT enabled teaching helps both slow and
advanced learners. Students are encouraged to participate in
competitions like quiz, debates, elocution; versification etc. at various
levels. We provide quality education to students through class room
teaching, career counseling, Personality Development and Spoken
English Programs and make them able to compete in the job market. At
the end of each period students are allowed to individually meet the
teacher in order to resolve doubts on topics taught in a class room.
Faculty Members are encouraged to organize departmental seminars
and workshops with active involvement of students facilitating
collaborative and independent learning among students.

AI technology is increasing efficiency and performance in businesses by automating procedures or jobs that previously needed human labour. Additionally, AI is able to interpret data at a scale beyond human comprehension. That ability can yield significant business advantages. Repetitive learning and data-driven discovery are automated by AI. Artificial Intelligence handles repetitive, high-volume, digital activities rather than automating manual ones. And it does so without growing weary.

                            The lab focuses on conducting practical assignments related to cloud computing and virtualization. Cloud computing is on-demand access, via the internet, to computing resources—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage, development tools, networking capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed by a cloud services provider (or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them according to usage. The term ‘cloud computing’ also refers to the technology that makes cloud work. This includes some form of virtualized IT infrastructure—servers, operating system software, networking, and other infrastructure that’s abstracted, using special software, so that it can be pooled and divided irrespective of physical hardware boundaries. For example, a single hardware server can be divided into multiple virtual servers.
